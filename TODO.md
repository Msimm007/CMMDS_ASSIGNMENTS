Bellow are the tasks in the TODO section. As we take something on, move it to the In Progress section and write your name on it. When that is done, move it to the Done section.

### TODO 

Question 2: 

- [ ] Implement code for the objective function.
- [ ] Implement Gradient and Hessian
- [ ] Check implementations
- [ ] nlrlsq_deriv_check.py script

### In Progress

(Marco)
Question 1:

- [ ] check f is convex for matrix Q.
- [ ] check f is convex for Q s.p.d.
- [x] quadobj_cvx_check.py script

Comments: I think this is mostly completed but I think I have bugs in the visuals because I'm calling Mang's stuff incorrectly, will fix the code soon.
